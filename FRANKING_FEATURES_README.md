Gross Dividend = Cash Dividend + Franking Credit
Tax Benefit = Min(Franking Credit, Tax on Gross Dividend)
```

### **Tax Brackets (2024-25)**
- **$0 - $18,200**: 0% (Tax-free threshold)
- **$18,201 - $45,000**: 19%
- **$45,001 - $120,000**: 32.5%
- **$120,001 - $180,000**: 37%
- **$180,001+**: 45%

### **Medicare Levy**: 2% (above $23,226 threshold)

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### **Example 1: High-Income Earner ($120,000)**

- **Annual Dividend**: $2,000 (4% yield)
- **Franking Credits**: $857
- **Tax Benefit**: $857 (reduces tax liability)
- **Effective Yield**: 5.7% (vs 4% without franking)

### **Example 2: Retiree ($30,000 income)**

- **Total Cash Return**: $2,857 (7.1% effective yield)

### **Example 3: Mixed Portfolio Optimization**
